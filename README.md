# cats-and-dogs
Cats and dogs is a project designed to provide a template for pet shelters to make their own websites. The existing codebase should be easily portable for new users and only requires shelters update their petfinder listings to stay current. It offers users the ability to search, view, save and share animals as well as find information on breeds.
